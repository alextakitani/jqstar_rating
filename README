jqstar_rating
============

This plugin is completely based on edgarjs's ajaxful-rating http://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating

Why?
===========
I made it because I have a different point of view on how a rating plugin should work, also
I wanted it to work with Jquery, since I'm using it already on my projects.

Details
============
Edgar's work on the model part of the plugin was perfect for my needs, so I've copied it shamelessly.
For the view part, i made a new helper, with generates code to use the jQuery Star Widget http://orkans-tmp.22web.net/star_rating/
