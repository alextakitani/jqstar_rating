jqstar_rating
============

This plugin is completely based on edgarjs's ajaxful-rating http://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating

Why?
===========
I made it because I have a different point of view on how a rating plugin should work, also
I wanted it to work with Jquery, since I'm using it already on my projects.

Details
============
Edgar's work on the model part of the plugin was perfect for my needs, so I've copied it shamelessly.
For the view part, I've made a new helper, with generates code to use the jQuery Star Widget http://orkans-tmp.22web.net/star_rating/

And the thanks goes to...
==========================
Edgar for the amazing job on witch this plugin is based

My beloved wife Fernanda who motivated me saying: "Hey I like when pages have those star things".

                                  
Installation & Setup
=====================

1. install using:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/alextakitani/jqstar_rating.git

2. run the generator that will bla bla bla...

    script/generate jqstar_rating user

 The generator takes as argument the name of *YOUR* user model. 

3. configure your models adding to them:

    class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
      jqstar_rateable :stars => 10,:dimensions => [:acting,:screen_play]
    end

    The accepted parameters are:

    :stars The number of stars
    :cache_column Name of the column for storing the cached rating average.
    :dimensions Array of dimensions. Allows to rate the model on various dimensions. On the
    above example, acting and screen play.

    Configure also your user model, adding a relation to the Rate model

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
       has_many :rates
    end

4. modify your routes to map a rate action:

    map.resources :movies, :member => {:rate => :post}
